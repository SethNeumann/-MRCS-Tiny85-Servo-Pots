A simple servo controller to replace Mark Schutzer's PIC based design for which the PIC has become unavbailable.
This controls an SG90 or similar low cost servo. End travel positions are set with 2 pots.  There is a single
input line which is grounded to reverse the turnout. An onboard push button is provided to easy calibration. In
addition to the servo output a LED is provided with onboard limiting resistor.
